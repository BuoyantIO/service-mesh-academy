# Gateway API 101

**This is NOT the executable code for the Gateway API 101 Service Mesh
Academy.** Start with `IAN.md` instead!

- `IAN.md` fills the role of the infrastructure provider, firing up a managed
  cluster for Chihiro.
- `CHIHIRO.md` fills the role of the cluster operator, getting a Gateway set
  up for Ana.
- `ANA.md` fills the role of the application developer, installing Faces and
  setting up routes.
- `MESH-ROUTING.md` shows further mesh routing examples (which might be either
  Ana or Chihiro).
