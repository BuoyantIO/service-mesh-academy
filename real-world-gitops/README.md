# Real World GitOps

Looking for the repo for the "Real World GitOps" Service Mesh Academy?? You'll
find it at https://github.com/BuoyantIO/gitops-linkerd rather than in here.

## But why isn't it here??

When you're working with GitOps, you need to be making Git commits and pushing
them to your repo, which means that when you follow the directions for the
Real World GitOps Service Mesh Academy, you need to fork its repo and then do
work in your own copy. That makes it less clumsy to have the code for that
workshop in its own repo, rather than living in this much larger repo.
