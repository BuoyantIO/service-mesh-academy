## Introduction



In this hands-on demonstration, we will deploy Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd on a `k3d` Kubernetes cluster and will demonstrate how to quickly enable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL).

## What is Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd (BEL)

[Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd](https://buoyant.io/enterprise-linkerd)

What does Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd give you, compared to open source Linkerd?

**Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd Features:**

- High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)
- Security Policy Generation
- FIPS-140-2/3 Compliance
- Lifecycle Automation
- Enterprise-Hardened Images
- Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)
- Strict SLAs Around CVE Remediation

We're going to try out security policy generation and HAZL in this demo, but remember that we'll get all the BEL features, *except for FIPS*, which isn't included in the Trial license.

## Demonstration: Overview

In this demonstration, we're going to do the following:

- Deploy a `k3d` Kubernetes cluster
- Deploy Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd with HAZL disabled
- Deploy the `colorz` application to generate multi-zonal traffic
- Monitor traffic from the `colorz` application, with HAZL disabled
- Enable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)
- Monitor traffic from the `colorz` application, with HAZL enabled
- Disable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)
- Monitor traffic from the `colorz` application, with HAZL disabled

### Prerequisites

**If you'd like to follow along, you're going to need the following:**

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [k3d](https://k3d.io)
- [step](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation/)
- The `watch` command must be installed and working

All prerequisites must be *installed* and *working properly* before proceeding.  The instructions in the provided links will get you there.

### The `colorz` Application

This repository includes the `colorz` application, which generate traffic across multiple availability zones in our Kubernetes cluster, allowing us to observe the effects High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL) has on traffic.

## Task 1: Clone the `deploying-bel-with-hazl` Repository

[GitHub: Deploying Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd with High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)](https://github.com/southsidedean/deploying-bel-with-hazl)

Clone the GitHub repository to your working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BuoyantIO/service-mesh-academy.git
```

Change directory to the repository:

```bash
cd service-mesh-academy/deploying-bel-with-hazl
```

## Task 2: Deploy a Cluster Using `k3d`

We can use the following commands to have `k3d` create a cluster with 3 availability zones.

Check for existing `k3d` clusters:

```bash
k3d cluster list
```

If you'd like to *delete* any existing clusters, use:

```bash
k3d cluster delete <<cluster-name>>
```

Create the `demo-cluster` cluster, using the configuration file in `cluster/hazl.yaml`:

```bash
k3d cluster create -c cluster/hazl.yaml --wait
```

Check for our `demo-cluster` cluster:

```bash
k3d cluster list
```

Checking out cluster using `kubectl`:

*Nodes:*

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

*Pods:*

```bash
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -A -o wide --sort-by .metadata.namespace
```

## Task 3: Obtain Certificates



### Create Certificates Using `step`

[Generating the certificates with `step`](https://linkerd.io/2.14/tasks/generate-certificates/#generating-the-certificates-with-step)

If you'd like to generate your own secure certificates, you can use `step` to do so.

#### Trust Anchor Certificate

If you want to generate your own certificates using `step`, use the `certs` directory:

```bash
cd certs
```

Generate the root certificate with its private key (using step):

```bash
step certificate create root.linkerd.cluster.local ca.crt ca.key \
--profile root-ca --no-password --insecure
```

This generates the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` files. The `ca.crt` file is what you need to pass to the `--identity-trust-anchors-file` option when installing Linkerd with the CLI, and the `identityTrustAnchorsPEM` value when installing the `linkerd-control-plane` chart with Helm.

*Note: We use `--no-password` `--insecure` to avoid encrypting those files with a passphrase.*

For a longer-lived trust anchor certificate, pass the `--not-after` argument to the step command with the desired value (e.g. `--not-after=87600h`).

#### Issuer Certificate and Key

Next, generate the intermediate certificate and key pair that will be used to sign the Linkerd proxiesâ€™ CSR.

```bash
step certificate create identity.linkerd.cluster.local issuer.crt issuer.key \
--profile intermediate-ca --not-after 8760h --no-password --insecure \
--ca ca.crt --ca-key ca.key
```

This will generate the `issuer.crt` and `issuer.key` files.

Checking our certificates:

```bash
ls -la
```

Change back to the parent directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

## Task 4: Deploy Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd Without HAZL

[Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd: Installation](https://docs.buoyant.io/buoyant-enterprise-linkerd/installation/)

[Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd Trial](https://docs.buoyant.io/buoyant-enterprise-linkerd/installation/trial/)

Next, we will walk through the process of installing Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd. This trial includes access to a brand-new
enterprise routing feature, High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL).

### Step 1: Obtain Trial Credentials

To get system credentials for accessing the Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd trial images, go to the [Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd Installation page](https://enterprise.buoyant.io/start_trial), and follow the instructions.

You should end up with a set of credentials in environment variables like this:

```bash
export API_CLIENT_ID=[CLIENT_ID]
export API_CLIENT_SECRET=[CLIENT_SECRET]
export BUOYANT_LICENSE=[LICENSE]
```

Add these to a file in the root of the repository, named `settings.sh`, plus add a new line with the cluster name, `export CLUSTER_NAME=demo-cluster`, like this:

```bash
export API_CLIENT_ID=[CLIENT_ID]
export API_CLIENT_SECRET=[CLIENT_SECRET]
export BUOYANT_LICENSE=[LICENSE]
export CLUSTER_NAME=demo-cluster
```

Check the contents of the `settings.sh` file:

```bash
more settings.sh
```

Source the file, to load the variables:

```bash
source settings.sh
```

Your credentials have been loaded into environment variables, and we can proceed with installing Buoyant Enterprise Linkerd (BEL).

### Step 2: Download the BEL CLI

Next, download the BEL CLI:

```bash
curl -sL https://enterprise.buoyant.io/install-preview | sh
```

Add the CLI executables to your `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=/home/tdean/.linkerd2/bin:$PATH
```

### Step 3: Run Pre-Checks

Check the `API_CLIENT_ID` environment variable:

```bash
echo $API_CLIENT_ID
```

Confirm the `API_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable:

```bash
echo $API_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Confirm the `BUOYANT_LICENSE` environment variable:

```bash
echo $BUOYANT_LICENSE
```

Confirm the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable:

```bash
echo $CLUSTER_NAME
```

Validate that your cluster is ready for installation:

```bash
linkerd check --pre
```

### Step 4: Install BEL Operator Components

We'll use the `linkerd-buoyant` Helm chart to install the operator:

```bash
helm repo add linkerd-buoyant https://helm.buoyant.cloud
helm repo update
```

Now, we can install the BEL operator itself:

```bash
helm install linkerd-buoyant \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace linkerd-buoyant \
  --set metadata.agentName=cluster1 \
  --set api.clientID=$API_CLIENT_ID \
  --set api.clientSecret=$API_CLIENT_SECRET \
linkerd-buoyant/linkerd-buoyant
```

After the install, wait for the metrics agent to be ready, then run the post-install operator health checks:

```bash
kubectl rollout status daemonset/buoyant-cloud-metrics -n linkerd-buoyant
linkerd buoyant check
```

### Step 5: Create the Identity Secret



Use the [Linkerd Trust Root CA & Identity Certificates & Keys](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/generate-certificates/#generating-the-certificates-with-step) to create a Kubernetes Secret that will be used by Helm at runtime. You will need `ca.crt`, `issuer.crt`, and `issuer.key` files.

Generate the `linkerd-identity-secret.yaml` manifest:

```bash
cat <<EOF > linkerd-identity-secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca.crt: $(base64 < certs/ca.crt | tr -d '\n')
  tls.crt: $(base64 < certs/issuer.crt| tr -d '\n')
  tls.key: $(base64 < certs/issuer.key | tr -d '\n')
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: linkerd-identity-issuer
  namespace: linkerd
type: kubernetes.io/tls
EOF
```

Create the `linkerd-identity-secret` secret:

```bash
kubectl apply -f linkerd-identity-secret.yaml
```

### Step 6: Create a Linkerd BEL Operator CRD

Create a CRD config that will be used by the Linkerd BEL operator to install and manage the Linkerd control plane. You will need the `ca.crt` file from above.  This CRD configuration also enables High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL), using the `- -experimental-endpoint-zone-weights` `experimentalArgs`.  We're going to omit the `- -experimental-endpoint-zone-weights` in the `experimentalArgs` for now, by commenting it out with a `#` in the manifest.

```bash
cat <<EOF > linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml
apiVersion: linkerd.buoyant.io/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlane
metadata:
  name: linkerd-control-plane
spec:
  components:
    linkerd:
      version: preview-24.1.3
      license: $BUOYANT_LICENSE
      controlPlaneConfig:
        proxy:
          image:
            version: preview-24.1.3-hazl
        identityTrustAnchorsPEM: |
$(sed 's/^/          /' < certs/ca.crt )
        identity:
          issuer:
            scheme: kubernetes.io/tls
        destinationController:
          experimentalArgs:
          # - -experimental-endpoint-zone-weights
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
                operator: DoesNotExist
EOF
```

### Step 7: Install Linkerd

Apply the ControlPlane CRD config to have the Linkerd BEL operator create the Linkerd control plane:

```bash
kubectl apply -f linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml
```

### Step 8: Verify Linkerd Installation

After the installation is complete, you can watch the deployment of the Control Plane using `kubectl`:

```bash
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -A -o wide --sort-by .metadata.namespace
```

You can verify the health and configuration of Linkerd by running the `linkerd check` command:

```bash
linkerd check
```

### Step 9: Create the Dataplane Objects for `linkerd-buoyant`

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: linkerd.buoyant.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataPlane
metadata:
  name: linkerd-buoyant
  namespace: linkerd-buoyant
spec:
  workloadSelector:
    matchLabels: {}
EOF
```

With that you will see the Linkerd proxy get added to your Buoyant Cloud Agent.  You've successfully installed your trial of Buoyant Enterprise for Linkerd. You can now use Linkerd to manage and secure your Kubernetes applications.

To make adjustments to your Linkerd deployment simply edit and re-apply the previously-created `linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml` CRD config.

### Step 10: Monitor Buoyant Cloud Metrics Rollout and Check Proxies

```bash
kubectl rollout status daemonset/buoyant-cloud-metrics -n linkerd-buoyant
```

```bash
linkerd check --proxy -n linkerd-buoyant
```

## Deploy the `colorz` Application

*Let's generate some traffic!*

```bash
kubectl apply -k colorz
```

We can check the status of `colorz` by watching the rollout:

```bash
watch -n 1 kubectl get pods -A -o wide --sort-by .metadata.namespace
```

### Create Security Policy

```bash
linkerd policy generate | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Monitor Traffic Without HAZL

Let's take a look at traffic flow without HAZL enabled.

### Using Buoyant Cloud

Let's take a look at what traffic looks like in Buoyant Cloud.  This will give us a more visual representation of our baseline traffic.

## Enable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)

Let's take a look at how quick and easy we can enable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL).

Remember, to make adjustments to your Linkerd deployment simply edit and re-apply the previously-created `linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml` CRD config.  We're going to enable the `- -experimental-endpoint-zone-weights` in the `experimentalArgs` for now, by uncommenting it in the manifest:

Edit the `linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml` file:

```bash
vim linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml
```

Apply the ControlPlane CRD config to have the Linkerd BEL operator update the Linkerd control plane configuration, and enable HAZL:

```bash
kubectl apply -f linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml
```

Now, we can see the effect HAZL has on the traffic in our multi-az cluster.

## Monitor Traffic With HAZL

Let's take a look at what traffic looks like with HAZL enabled.

### Using Buoyant Cloud

Let's take a look at what traffic looks like in Buoyant Cloud.  This will give us a more visual representation of the effect of HAZL on our traffic.

## Disable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL)

Let's take a look at how quick and easy we can disable High Availability Zonal Load Balancing (HAZL), and the effect it has on the traffic of our `colorz` application.

Remember, to make adjustments to your Linkerd deployment simply edit and re-apply the previously-created `linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml` CRD config.  We're going to disable the `- -experimental-endpoint-zone-weights` in the `experimentalArgs` for now, by commenting it out in the manifest:

Edit the `linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml` file:

```bash
vim linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml
```

Apply the ControlPlane CRD config to have the Linkerd BEL operator update the Linkerd control plane configuration, and enable HAZL:

```bash
kubectl apply -f linkerd-control-plane-config.yaml
```

Now, we can see the effect HAZL has on the traffic in our multi-az cluster.

## Monitor Traffic With HAZL

Let's take a look at what traffic looks like with HAZL disabled.

### Using Buoyant Cloud

Let's take a look at what traffic looks like in Buoyant Cloud.  This will give us a more visual representation of the effect of HAZL on our traffic.
