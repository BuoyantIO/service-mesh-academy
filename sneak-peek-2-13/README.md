# Sneak Peek: Linkerd 2.13

This is the documentation - and executable code! - for the Service Mesh
Academy workshop about what's coming in Linkerd 2.13. The easiest way to use
this file is to execute it with [demosh].

Things in Markdown comments are safe to ignore when reading this later. When
executing this with [demosh], things after the horizontal rule below (which
is just before a commented `@SHOW` directive) will get displayed.

For this workshop, you'll need a running, empty, Kubernetes cluster that can
support `LoadBalancer` services. You can use `create-cluster.sh` to create an
appropriate `k3d` cluster.

# Sneak Peek: Linkerd 2.13

Welcome to the Service Mesh Academy Sneak Peek for Linkerd 2.13!

We're going to start by installing the most recent edge release of Linkerd,
since stable-2.13.0 isn't out yet:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://run.linkerd.io/install-edge | sh
```

Once that's done, we can proceed to install Linkerd into our cluster.

```bash
linkerd check --pre
linkerd install --crds | kubectl apply -f -
linkerd install | kubectl apply -f -
linkerd check
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

Next, we'll install the Faces demo (https://github.com/BuoyantIO/faces-demo),
using Emissary as the ingress controller.

This bit honestly isn't very interesting (it's literally just grabbing some
YAML, running it through `linkerd inject`, and then running that through
`kubectl apply`) so we're going to run through it pretty quickly. It's in
`setup-demo.sh`.

<!-- @wait -->

```bash
#@immed
$SHELL setup-demo.sh
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

OK! At this point, we'll point a couple of web browsers to the Faces
demo, at `http://localhost/faces/`.

One browser should be completely normal; the other should use an
extension like `ModHeader` to add the header `X-Faces-User: testuser`
to its requests. Both should show the same thing right now: a bunch of
smiley faces on green backgrounds. The one using `ModHeader` should
also say "User: testuser" at the top.

## Canary routing

The simplest sort of dynamic request routing we can do is the _canary_:
route a small fraction of traffic destined for a workload to a new
version of the workload, so you can make sure the new version works
without destroying the user experience if it doesn't. Here's a simple
way to do that using an HTTPRoute:

```bash
bat k8s/02-canary/color-canary.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

If we apply this, we'll see 10% of the `color` traffic go to `color2`,
which will return blue, instead of green.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/02-canary/color-canary.yaml
```

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_slides -->
<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @clear -->
<!-- @show_composite -->

We can edit the weights to change the distribution of traffic: for
example, if we edit the weights so that both are `weight: 50`, we'll
get an even split between green and blue.

```bash
kubectl edit -n faces httproute/color-canary
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

If we edit one of the backends to have `weight: 0`, that backend will
get no traffic. (We could also delete the `backendRef` entry entirely.)
So it's easy for us to make all the backgrounds blue with another
`kubectl edit`.

```bash
kubectl edit -n faces httproute/color-canary
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## A/B Tests

Another straightforward type of dynamic request routing we can do is
A/B testing. Here, rather than the random distribution of requests we
saw with the canary, we instead use some characteristic of the request
to choose where to route the request.

We'll do an A/B test with the `X-Faces-User` header and the `smiley`
service: any request with `X-Faces-User: testuser` will see the
heart-eyes smiley (üòç) instead of the "normal" smiley face (üòÉ). Our
browser windows show the value they're sending for `X-Faces-User`
above the grid of smilies ("unknown" means no header is being sent).
Both browsers currently show the same smiley.

<!-- @wait_clear -->

Here's the HTTPRoute that causes the A/B test to happen:

```bash
bat k8s/03-abtest/smiley-ab.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

When we apply this, we'll continue to see "normal" smilies from our
first browser, but our second will show the heart-eyes smiley:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/03-abtest/smiley-ab.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

When the A/B test is done, if we want, we can easily edit the HTTPRoute
to give everyone heart eyes:

```bash
kubectl edit -n faces httproute/smiley-a-b
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->
