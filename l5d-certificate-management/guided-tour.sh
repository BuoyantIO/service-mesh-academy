######## THE TOUR

# To run the tour, you'll need
#
# * a Kubernetes cluster and the `kubectl` command
#    * you can run `cycle-cluster.sh` to create a suitable `k3d` cluster
# * the `linkerd` CLI â€” https://linkerd.io/2.12/getting-started/
# * the `step` CLI â€” https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation
# * the `helm` CLI â€” https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/
