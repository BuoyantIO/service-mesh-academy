## This linkerd-trust-anchor ClusterIssuer uses a self-signed certificate
## stored in the linkerd-identity-trust-roots Secret in the cert-manager
## namespace.
##
## For anything like production use, you'd reconfigure this ClusterIssuer to
## use an external CA store for security. Storing the trust anchor's secret
## key in the cluster is a bad idea.
