## NOTE: We're configuring cert-manager here, but since this is all about the
## issuer certs, we'll use the linkerd namespace (since Linkerd must have
## access to the private keys for the issuer certs). This means that you'll
## need to create the linkerd namespace before applying this manifest, since
## you need to get cert-manager running before installing Linkerd.
##
## This Certificate resource tells cert-manager how to create the Linkerd
## issuer certificate in the linkerd namespace, using the linkerd-trust-anchor
## ClusterIssuer to sign it. Check the options below to make sure the
## certificate suits your needs.
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: linkerd-identity-issuer
  # NOTE: pay attention to the namespace here!
  namespace: linkerd
spec:
  # Set the common name of the subject.
  commonName: identity.linkerd.cluster.local
  ## This is itself a CA certificate...
  isCA: true
  usages:
  - cert sign
  - crl sign
  - server auth
  - client auth
  ## ...and it's only good for 48 hours, so make sure to renew it
  ## no more than 25 hours after it's issued.
  duration: 48h
  renewBefore: 25h
  ## It must be issued (signed) by our linkerd-trust-anchor ClusterIssuer.
  issuerRef:

    kind: ClusterIssuer
  # It uses a 256-bit ECDSA private key...
  privateKey:
    algorithm: ECDSA
  # ...and the private key will be stored in the Secret named
  # linkerd-identity-issuer (which is where Linkerd expects to find it).
