# Linkerd 2.13 Dynamic Request Routing and Circuit Breaking

This is the documentation - and executable code! - for the Service Mesh
Academy workshop about what's coming in Linkerd 2.13. The easiest way to use
this file is to execute it with [demosh].

Things in Markdown comments are safe to ignore when reading this later. When
executing this with [demosh], things after the horizontal rule below (which
is just before a commented `@SHOW` directive) will get displayed.

For this workshop, you'll need a running Kubernetes cluster set up with
Linkerd, Emissary, and the Faces app. You can use `create-cluster.sh` to
create an appropriate `k3d` cluster, and `setup-demo.sh` to initialize it.

<!-- set -e >
<!-- @import demosh/check-requirements.sh -->
<!-- @import demosh/demo-tools.sh -->

<!-- @start_livecast -->

```bash
BAT_STYLE="grid,numbers"
```

You'll also want two web browsers running pointing to the Faces app at
(assuming you used `create-cluster.sh` to set up your cluster)
https://localhost/faces/ -- one normal one, and one using ModHeader or the
like to set `X-Faces-User: testuser` for the canarying test.

# Dynamic Request Routing and Circuit Breaking

Two significant new features in Linkerd 2.13 are dynamic request routing and
circuit breaking.

Dynamic request routing permits HTTP routing based on headers, HTTP method,
etc. We'll use this to demonstrate progessive delivery and A/B testing deep in
the call graph of our application.

Circuit breaking is a resilience feature that allows Linkerd to stop sending
requests to endpoints that fail too much. We'll use this to protect our
application from a failing workload.

## Dynamic Request Routing: Progressive Delivery

As running right now, the Faces GUI should be showing all grinning faces on
green backgrounds. We can see that with a web browser.

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_3 -->

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_5 -->

The green background comes from the `color` workload. If we have a new version
of that workload (`color2`) which returns blue instead of green, we can slowly
shift traffic to `color2` using a new `HTTPRoute` resource.

<!-- @wait_clear -->

Here's the resource we'll apply:

```bash
#@immed
bat k8s/02-canary/color-canary-10.yaml
```

When we apply that, we should immediately see 10% of the
backgrounds shift to blue.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/02-canary/color-canary-10.yaml
```

<!-- @wait -->

Let's take a quick look at the demo architecture again to
see what's going on here.

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_1 -->

<!-- @wait_clear -->
<!-- @show_5 -->

## Dynamic Request Routing: Progressive Delivery

We can change the amount of traffic by changing the weights. For example, now
that we see 10% blue working, we can shift to a 50/50 split:

```bash
diff -u99 --color k8s/02-canary/color-canary-{10,50}.yaml
```

Applying that, we'll immediately see the amount of
blue backgrounds increase.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/02-canary/color-canary-50.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## Dynamic Request Routing: Progressive Delivery

Finally, when we're happy with the 50/50 split, we can shift to routing all
our traffic to the blue `color2` service. We could do this by deleting one of
our `backendRefs`, but here we'll show using a `weight` of 0 instead:

```bash
diff -u99 --color k8s/02-canary/color-canary-{50,100}.yaml
```

Applying that, we should see no green backgrounds at all.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/02-canary/color-canary-100.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->
<!-- @show_2 -->

## Dynamic Request Routing: A/B Testing

Another thing we can do with dynamic request routing is A/B testing deep in
the call graph, where the ingress controller can't reach. Here we'll use two
browsers to show an A/B test where all requests with the header

`X-Faces-Header: testuser`

get routed to a different `smiley` workload (named `smiley2`), which returns a
heart eyes smiley instead of the normal grinning smiley.

One browser is "normal" and will not send the `X-Faces-User` header. It will
show `User: unknown`.

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_browser_1 -->
<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_2 -->

The other browser is set up using the ModHeader
extension to send `X-Faces-User: testuser`. It will show `User: testuser`.

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_browser_2 -->
<!-- @wait_clear -->
<!-- @show_4 -->

## Dynamic Request Routing: A/B Testing

Here we have both browsers visible: the top browser sends no
`X-Faces-User`, the bottom browser is using ModHeader to
send `X-Faces-User: testuser`.

<!-- @wait -->

Here's the HTTPRoute we'll add to do the A/B test:

```bash
#@immed
bat k8s/03-abtest/smiley-ab.yaml
```

<!-- @wait -->

Applying that, we will immediately start to see the browser
setting the `X-Faces-User: testuser` header start getting
heart eyes smilies.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/03-abtest/smiley-ab.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## Dynamic Request Routing: A/B Testing

Once we're happy that the B side of our A/B test results in
happy users (maybe they really like the heart eyes smiley?)
we can delete the `matches` clause entirely, and change the
`backendRefs` of the route to unconditionally route all
traffic to our `smiley2` workload.

Here's the HTTPRoute:

```bash
#@immed
bat k8s/03-abtest/smiley2-unconditional.yaml
```

<!-- @wait -->

Applying it will result in both browsers getting heart eyes
smilies:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/03-abtest/smiley2-unconditional.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->
<!-- @show_2 -->

## Circuit Breaking

On to circuit breaking!

Circuit breaking stops routing traffic to failing endpoints. To demonstrate
this, we'll first switch the Faces GUI to show us which Pods we're getting
responses from â€“ this will make it easier to see when the breakers open and
close.

<!-- @wait -->
<!-- @show_browser_1 -->
<!-- @wait_clear -->
<!-- @show_5 -->

At this point, we're getting responses from two `face` Pods.
These Pods are part of the `face` Deployment, and the `face`
Service uses labels to select those Pods for traffic.

Let's add two more Pods behind the `face` Service. These will
be the `face2` Deployment, but they have labels so that they
will also be matched by the label selector on the `face` service.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/04-circuit-breaking/face2.yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->
## Circuit Breaking

The big new thing in the `face2` Deployment is that its Pods
will rapidly get stuck in an error state, which will appear as
a "meh" face on a pink background, and stay there until they
get no traffic for awhile.

We'll start by waiting until our browser shows the `face2` Pods
returning failures.

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## Circuit Breaking

Now that we see failures, we'll enable circuit breaking. At the moment, this
is configured by annotations. We'll set it to break the circuit after 30
consecutive failures (which happens quickly in this demo), and to stay failed
for at least 10 seconds.

```bash
kubectl annotate -n faces svc/face \
    balancer.linkerd.io/failure-accrual=consecutive \
    balancer.linkerd.io/failure-accrual-consecutive-max-failures=30 \
    balancer.linkerd.io/failure-accrual-consecutive-min-penalty=10s
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## Circuit Breaking

At this point, we should be back to seeing blue backgrounds and grinning
faces, except for every so often when a request will be allowed through to see
if the `face2` Pods have recovered. Eventually they will, after which they'll
continue getting traffic until the next time they fail and the circuit breaker
opens.

## Dynamic Request Routing and Circuit Breaking

There you have it, a quick tour of dynamic request routing and circuit
breaking in Linkerd 2.13! This area will be evolving quickly; keep an eye out
for future workshops!

## One More Thing...

There's a new `linkerd diagnostics policy` command which can help a lot with
dynamic request routing:

```bash
linkerd diagnostics policy -n faces svc/smiley 80 | bat -l yaml
```

It is _extremely_ verbose, but it can tell you great things about exactly
what's up with complex routing situations. Let's restore one of the `color`
routes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/02-canary/color-canary-50.yaml
```

...and then check `linkerd diagnostics policy` for `color`.

```bash
linkerd diagnostics policy -n faces svc/color 80 | bat -l yaml
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## One More Thing...

Unfortunately, there's not a cool diagnostic thing that will show you circuit
breakers directly. We can, though, use `linkerd viz stat` to infer things:
specifically, `linkerd viz stat pods` is pretty powerful here.

For example, if we look at traffic to the `face` _Deployment_, we just see
traffic as usual.

```bash
linkerd viz stat deployment -n faces face
```

However, if we look at all the _Pods_ with the `service=face` label that the
`face` Service will select, we can see which Pods are taking traffic... and
which are not.

```bash
linkerd viz stat pods -n faces -l "service=face"
```

<!-- @wait_clear -->

## One More Thing...

One note: it takes awhile for the `linkerd viz stat` numbers to really catch
up to changing situations, so be prepared to give it a minute or two to really
get the measure of things after you change anything.

Thanks for watching!!
