# Practical Multicluster

This is the documentation - and executable code! - for the Service Mesh
Academy workshop about practical applications of Linkerd multicluster. The
easiest way to use this file is to execute it with [demosh].

Things in Markdown comments are safe to ignore when reading this later. When
executing this with [demosh], things after the horizontal rule below (which
is just before a commented `@SHOW` directive) will get displayed.
